# v2 TODOs

- migrate
	- run v1, import backup
	- verify that v2 sees it
	- implement migration - this needs main logic to be written (grouping, price, paid stuff)
- log screen
- charts - where? separate page?
- navbar center: show name - maybe this will be link to settings
- settings page
	- show database metrics, record count, timespan
	- API key change - verify player ID!
	- export/import feature
	- clear feature
- import feature should be accessible from the start screens, between migrate and connect
