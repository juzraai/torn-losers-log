# v2 TODOs

- contract grouping: need another key, like `contract`? (then rename `group` to `session`)
- log items:
	- events mode: hide number
	- group mode: show events in collapsible (or modal?)
- log paging
	- where?
	- maybe just add a "Show more" on the bottom to get +10 items
- paid/unpaid logic
	- will be tricky, I have to regenerate group IDs, starting right after the previous newest unmodified attack and CANNOT filter records for this, I have to iterate all... (or else I mess up sessions in case there's something else in between)
- set price logic
	- this will need group ID regeneration too...
- settings page
	- show database metrics, record count, timespan
	- API key change - verify player ID!
	- export/import feature
	- clear feature
- import feature should be accessible from the start screens, between migrate and connect
- refresh logic - watch out for group ID generation!
- charts - where? separate page?
- log controls:
	- show hidden (default false) (checkbox) icon???
	- on mobile, some buttons can go into a dropdown button
- will need an auto name resolver mechanism: like every 2secs a scheduled thing grabs an unresolved name from db and fetches the name from API
