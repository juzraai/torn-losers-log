# v2 TODOs

- live search:
	- input for player name or ID
	- runs search in players db -> ID list
	- filters for defender/attacker ID (in attacker/defender mode)
- name resolver service:
	- init from init.client.js
	- setInterval, 5s
	- find (somehow) 1 unresolved player ID
	- resolve it
- contract grouping: need another key, like `contract`? (then rename `group` to `session`)
- log items:
	- group mode: show events in collapsible (or modal with event mode list items?)
- log paging
	- where?
	- maybe just add a "Show more" on the bottom to get +10 items
- paid/unpaid logic
- set price logic
- settings page
	- show database metrics, record count, timespan
	- API key change - verify player ID!
	- export/import feature
	- clear feature
- import feature should be accessible from the start screens, between migrate and connect
- refresh logic - watch out for group ID generation!
- charts - where? separate page?
- log controls:
	- show hidden (default false) (checkbox) icon???
	- on mobile, some buttons can go into a dropdown button
