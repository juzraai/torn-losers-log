# TLL <small>(TORN City Losers' Log)</small>

**TLL** was originally designed only for loss sellers, but now (v2+) aims to help loss buying activity too, as it can:

- 🧾 📊 list, filter, group, count, plot,
- 🏷️ 💰 store price and paid status
- 💀 🏃 of losses **and escapes (NEW!)**
- 🎯 🛡️ you made **or received! (NEW!)**

It does all this entirely in your browser, which means your API key won't be sent out nor stored on a 3rd party server. (In fact, TLL doesn't have any server-side code or database, it's a static website.) However, this also means that you have to carry over your data manually, if you decide to switch browsers. **TLL** provides export and import mechanisms to help with that.
